## Graphs

There are many types of graphs. It is a combination of nodes and edges. 

Directed: Link is only occurring in one direction
Undirected: link is undirected
Weighted: Edges contain information about the path
Unweighted: no information on edge
Cyclic: Nodes can return to itself by continuing to traverse
Acyclic: Cannot return to the node by continuing the 

The performance of these are hard to generalize. They are primarily valuable for creating relationships. The ability to scale this type of data structure is difficult.
