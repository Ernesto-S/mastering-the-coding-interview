## Recursion

Is a common concept used to refer a function within itself. These are really good for repeated tasks, such as traversing a tree.

# Concerns

When working with recursion it can potentially cause a stack overflow issue. This can be dangerous since infinite loops can occur. The downside is that it also can take up more memory. 

the big O of recursion could be exponential issue. 2^n

# Mitigation

Creating a base case.
