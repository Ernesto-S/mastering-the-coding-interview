# Sorting

## Bubble Sort

Comes from the idea of comparing two values. The largest number is bubbled to the end of the list. This is one of the simplest sorting algorithm but it is also typically the slowest. Big O complexity of O(n^2)

## Insertion Sort
Is useful for time when the list is nearly sorted. Stepping through the list the value is inserted into its position

## Selection Sort
The first number is compared through out the list. The lowest number is found and then positions are swapped. 

## Merge Sort
Take a list and divide by half and this continues until the items are single items
