# Hash_Tables_Notes

In python Hash Tables are called dictionaries. These are data sets where you have a key and a value. The key is used to find the values in memory. 

- A downside of Hash tables is something called "Collision". Collision is when data is saved in the same memory location. This results in speed reduction.
