1. Can you do the job? 
2. Can I work with you?

## After the interview?

Email them a thank you. 

I'm sure you have lots of candidates to see, but I want to say one last thing.
There are no shortages of developers for you to interview.
However, there is a shortage of good, talented, egoless developers with ambition to learn.
It's not the ones that are unable to admit that they are wrong.
The best developers aren't the ones that know the language inside and out at the expense of having blinders.
It is not the ones who are unable to admit they are wrong.
I am not the most experienced developer that you may interview today, but the one thing that you can
guarantee is that there is nobody that you will interview that will work as hard to develop his or her
skill every day, play nicely with all the other developers at the company and isn't so narrow minded
and problem solving that he or she isn't willing to try new and novel ideas.
When you hire me, you will rest assured that you won't have to micromanage me.
You don't have to extinguish fires.
And in one year I'll be one of your most valuable employees.
I can guarantee that I am at a point in my career where I want to be surrounded by a team that I can
grow with and be surrounded by smart people like yourself.
And I've chosen this company specific for that reason.
And you've probably had similar experiences in your career where one company allows you to really have
an impact and propel your career.
I am at the stage now and I hope to be part of the team with you.
So thank you for your time and I hope to hear back soon from you.
